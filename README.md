**Mini Uber Project**

A project-based learning implementation of a ride-sharing (Uber-like) simulation built using Python (DSA) for the backend logic and a simple frontend (HTML/JS) for interaction. This project demonstrates graph algorithms, shortest path finding, backend API development, and frontend integration â€“ all tied together in a full-stack showcase.

**Features**


-> Graph-based city map with weighted edges (roads & distances)

-> Driver allocation system â€“ finds the nearest driver for a rider

-> Shortest path calculation using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

-> Fare calculation based on total distance traveled

-> REST API backend (Flask)

-> Frontend UI (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to request rides

**Core Concepts Learned**


-> DSA in action â†’ Graph representation, shortest path (Dijkstra)

-> Backend API design â†’ Flask endpoints, JSON responses

-> Frontend integration â†’ JavaScript fetch() to call backend

-> Git/GitHub workflow â†’ Branching, commits, repo structuring

-> Full-stack mindset â†’ How frontend & backend communicate

-> Project Development in Linux Environment



**Future Enhancements**

 -> Deploy backend (Render/Heroku) & frontend (Netlify/GitHub Pages)

 -> Extend frontend UI (map visualization, driver tracking)

 -> User auth (rider/driver profiles)
